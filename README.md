SQR- A Game

A mobile game made using the Unity 3D Engine, with code written in C#

This was my first project and attempt at video game development. Worked on from June 2018 to August 2018. \
All code, sprites, audio files, and animations can be found in the Assets folder. Sprites were made by me in Adobe Photoshop, and audio files are from freesound.org.
